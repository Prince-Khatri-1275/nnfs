# NNFS
## nnfs or Neural Network For Scratch
It is an approach of understanding the core fundamentals behind how neural networks actually works and learning the back-end of libraries like Tensorflow and PyTorch.
## WHat will we get from this
Not only learning but we will also be making a package {a python package} which we can later upload on pypi packages to make it availble to all peoples using python or at the very least we can make it available locally on the device which means you can import your nn data package anywhere from your device.
